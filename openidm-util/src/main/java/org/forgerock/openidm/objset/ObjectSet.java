/**
 * An interface that provides access methods on a set of objects. Objects are JSON object
 * structures composed of the basic Java types: {@link Map}, {@link List}, {@link String},
 * {@link Number}, {@link Boolean}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations define their own object identifier taxonomy. By convention, identifiers
 * should follow a URI relative path pattern. Identifiers are provided through the
 * {@code id} parameter in methods, and in the {@code _id} property within objects. In the
 * case where {@code id} parameter is {@code null}, the operation is being requested on the
 * object set itself.
 * <p>
 * Implementations can elect for objects in the set to be optimistically concurrent; if so,
 * an object's version is provided through the {@code rev} parameter in methods, and in
 * the {@code _rev} property within objects. Consumers of this interface should provide object
 * version in the {@code rev} parameters if the {@code read} method yields objects that
 * contain the {@code _rev} property.  
 * <p>
 * Implementations can define other reserved object property names with an underscore
 * {@code _} prefix.
