/**
 * An interface that provides resource-oriented access methods on a set of objects. Objects
 * are JSON object structures composed of the basic Java types: {@link Map}, {@link List},
 * {@link String}, {@link Number}, {@link Boolean}.
 * <p>
 * Implementations define their own object identifier taxonomy. By convention, identifiers
 * should follow the URI relative path pattern. Identifiers are provided through the
 * {@code id} parameter in methods, and in the {@code _id} property within objects. In the
 * case where {@code id} parameter is {@code null}, the operation is being requested on the
 * entire object set itself.
 * <p>
 * Implementations can elect for objects in the set to be optimistically concurrent; if so,
 * an object's version is provided through the {@code rev} parameter in methods, and in
 * the {@code _rev} property within objects.
 * <p>
 * Implementations can define other reserved object property names with an underscore
 * {@code _} prefix.
 * <p>
 * Consumers of this interface should provide object version in the {@code rev} parameters
 * the {@code get} method yields objects that contain the {@code _rev} property.
